### TASK


### Component Library
Create a `Component Library` for an online `Music`, `Video Games`, and `Movies` store.


## Brief
You work for a large scale ecommerce website that sells music, video games, and movies.
your team wants consistent and reusable components across the website, so your assignment
is to create a component library to support the project.


## To Do
* Create a new project
* Install storybook.js
* Create poster
* create poster grid
* create media details
* Add storyshots
* create app

## Toolbox
* storybook.js
* storyshots
* react


## Level 1
The most visually appealing way to display a colllection of media is to use the poster or album
artwork in any easy-to-use way like a grid.

create a new component library with storybook.js that includes the following base components:

* poster: a single media item represented by its artwork.
* poster grid: a grid of posters.
* media details: a media item's data including poster.


## Level 2
Maintaining a component library includes making sure the components always work. to do this, we can 
use snapshot testing to automatically test our components.

use the storybook add-on storyshots to add snapshot testing.


## Level 3
The purpose of building a component library is to use it in a project. using your newly created component
library, create a new react app using your favourite framework that shows the store's available music, 
video games, and movies (or your favourite of each).
